USE YOUR MIND GAME
**Instructions for Missionaries and Cannibals Crossing River Simulation**
 **1. Introduction:**
The Missionaries and Cannibals Crossing River Simulation is a C++ program the classic puzzle where three missionaries and three cannibals must cross a river, using a boat that can carry a maximum of two passengers. The objective is to transport all individuals from the left side to the right side of the river without leaving the missionaries outnumbered by cannibals on either side, which would result in failure.
 **2. Program Overview:**
 The program is written in C++ and utilizes console input and output for user interaction.
 It simulates the movement of missionaries and cannibals between the left and right sides of the river.
 The game continues until either the winning condition (all characters transported safely) or the losing condition (missionaries outnumbered by cannibals) is met.
 **Tips for Success:**
 Plan your moves carefully to ensure that the missionaries are never outnumbered by cannibals on either side of the river.
 Utilize the maximum capacity of the boat (two passengers) to minimize the number of trips required to transport all individuals.
 **Ending the Game:**
 If you successfully transport all three missionaries and three cannibals to the right side of the river, you win the game. A congratulatory message will be displayed.
 If at any point the missionaries are outnumbered by cannibals on either side of the river, the game ends in failure. A message indicating the loss will be displayed.
