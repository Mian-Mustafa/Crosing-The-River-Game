# 🚣‍♂️ Crossing-The-River-Game – *Use Your Mind!* 🧠

A classic logic puzzle implemented in C++: help the missionaries and cannibals safely cross the river — but think carefully, or the outcome could be deadly!


### 🎮 About the Game:

This project is a simulation of the **Missionaries and Cannibals** puzzle, where your goal is to transport three missionaries and three cannibals across a river using a boat — **with strict rules**.

* The **boat holds only two people at a time**.
* If at any point **cannibals outnumber missionaries** on either bank, the missionaries are eaten and the game ends in failure


### 💻 Features:

* ✅ Console-based user interaction
* ✅ Logical move validation
* ✅ Win/Lose detection with end messages
* ✅ Written in clean and simple **C++**



### 🧩 Game Objective:

Get all **3 missionaries** and **3 cannibals** safely to the other side of the river **without breaking the rules**.



### 📝 How to Play:

1. Choose how many missionaries and/or cannibals to place in the boat for each trip.
2. Move them across the river.
3. Watch the state update and plan your next move wisely.

> 💡 **Tip:** Always ensure missionaries are not outnumbered by cannibals on **either side**!


### 🏁 Win Condition:

* All characters reach the right side of the river **safely**.
* 🎉 A congratulatory message confirms your success.

### ❌ Lose Condition:

* Missionaries are outnumbered on either riverbank.
* ☠️ A failure message ends the game.


### 🔧 Technologies Used:

* **C++** (Console Application)
* Standard Input/Output

### 📂 Files Included:

* `main.cpp` – Complete logic of the simulation
* README – Game instructions and overview
